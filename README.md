# AOSD-FinalAssignment
Final Assignment for the university course Analysis of Spatio-Temporal data at the university of MÃ¼nster in the winter term 2017/2018

The topic of this final assignment is the climate change in Texas, USA

# Manifestation of the climate change in Texas from 1950 until today

## Abstract

We know about the climate change and its consequences since many years and a lot of research has been done in this field. The climate is a complex system compound of different elements like temperature, precipitation or wind. This paper aims to analyse the power of the climate change regarding these elements on the example of Texas. The effects of the climate change on air temperature, precipitation, wind speed and evaporation will be investigated. By analysing time series and kriging interpolations of data from weather stations across the state it showed out, that there is a remarkable climate change. The temperature is rising, precipitation slightly increases, wind speed slowed, and evaporation becomes weaker. This paper gives another evidence to the climate change and together with other examples we should take future political decisions with respect to research in this field.

## About the files in this repository:

In the data directory you will find two types of data sets:
* The directories with the years contain data from the different stations from the months January and August
* The time series directory contains daily measurements from 4 different stations spread across the state

The other folders contain scripts with parts of the conducted analysis and also scripts with some tests.

The R-markdown file is the one where all information is collected and also the file which will contains my final result. This is the resulting paper.

The HTML file is the already knitted version of my R-Markdown file.

To reproduce it, just download the repository and knit the R-markdown file. Be aware that the processing takes 5 - 10 minutes.

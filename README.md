# AOSD-FinalAssignment
Final Assignment for the university course Analysis of Spatio-Temporal data at the university of MÃ¼nster in the winter term 2017/2018

The topic of this final Assignment is the climate change in Texas, USA

# Manifestation of the climate change in Texas over the past 70 years

## Introduction and research questions:

We know about the climate change and it's consequences since many years and a lot of research has been done in this field. To examine these consequences on a real world example on my own I chose Texas as a very large but also very interseting state of the USA with many different climatic conditions. To have a deeper look on the consequences I will analyze the wind speed, the maximum temperature, the precipitation and the evaporation measured on different weather stations across the state over the last 70 years. To handle that large amount of data I will use only the January and the August of every ten years from 1945 to 2015. Furthermore I will analyze continuous timeseries data from 4 different stations that are located in different parts of the state with data from 1950 until today.
The research question then is: How has the climate changed in the past 70 years in Texas regarding the different climate parameters precipitation, temperature, wind and evaporation? Side questions to that would be: Are there differences between the climate change at the coast and in the interior and what is the forecast for the next years? Will it be stronger or could the climate change also become weaker?

## About the files in this repository:

In the data file you will find the datasets mentioned above:
* The directories with the years contain data from the different stations from the month January and August
* The timeseries directory contains timeseries data from 4 different stations spread across the state

The script files are some small scripts from me to try things out and you will find most of the code also in the markdowns

The R-markdown file is the one where all information is collected and also the file which will contain my final result. In the moment there is only one markdown for the pre final Assignment to show what my plans are.

The HTML file is the already knitted version of my R-Markdown file.

To reproduce it, just download the repository and knit the R-markdown file.
